# Gesture Impact Vision 🎥

## 🧩 Project Overview
Real-time gesture detection using Vision AI that triggers visual effects on the camera feed.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an AI-based gesture control system that uses body movements as input switches for interactive visual effects.

## 🔧 Key Technologies
- Openvino
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (real-time video processing)
- Python (main control logic)

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Capture live camera feed.
2. Detect body landmarks.
3. Classify gestures.
4. Trigger mapped visual effect.
